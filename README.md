# Ecommerce-Follow-Along

## Project Description
This project is an e-commerce application designed to provide users with a seamless online shopping experience. The application includes features such as product listings, user authentication, a shopping cart, and a secure checkout process. Our goal is to create a user-friendly and efficient platform for both buyers and sellers.

## Milestone 1: Project Overview
During this session, we covered the basics of setting up a project repository and initializing it with a README file. We also outlined the overall structure of our e-commerce application, including key features and the technologies we'll be using.

## Key Features
1. **User Authentication:** Secure registration and login functionality for users.
2. **Product Listings:** A catalog of products with search and filter options.
3. **Shopping Cart:** A feature allowing users to add, remove, and update products in their cart.
4. **Checkout Process:** A secure and user-friendly checkout process with payment integration.
5. **Order Management:** Order history and tracking for users and sellers.
6. **Admin Panel:** An admin interface for managing products, orders, and users.

## Milestone 2: Project Setup and Login Page

In this milestone, we have set up the project and implemented the Login Page. The following tasks were completed:
- Project setup and initialization
- Created the Login Page
- Implemented form validation
- Connected the Login Page to the backend API for user authentication
- completed setting for tailwind-css

## Milestone 3: Project Setup for Backend

### Achievements
In this milestone, we laid the foundation for the backend of the e-commerce application. Here are the key accomplishments:
- *Backend Folder Structure:* 
  - Created a structured folder hierarchy to organize routes, controllers, models, and middlewares.
  - Added placeholder files where necessary to establish a blueprint for future development.
- *Node.js Server Setup:*
  - Initialized and configured a Node.js server using Express.
  - Configured the server to listen on a designated port for API requests.
- *Database Connection:*
  - Integrated MongoDB into the project for efficient data storage.
  - Successfully established the connection between the server and the MongoDB database.
- *Basic Error Handling:*
  - Implemented a simple yet effective error-handling mechanism to provide clear error messages and ensure smooth server operation.

### Steps Completed
1. Set up dedicated folders for backend organization:
   - controllers/ for handling business logic.
   - models/ for defining the database schema.
   - middlewares/ for utilities like authentication (to be expanded in future milestones).
2. Installed necessary dependencies (express, mongoose, etc.) and created the entry file (index.js).
3. Configured and tested the database connection using MongoDB.
4. Added basic error-handling middleware for better debugging and user feedback.
